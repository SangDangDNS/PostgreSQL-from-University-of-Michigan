# PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization
I have started studying with the [PostgreSQL from University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/postgresql-for-everybody#outcomes) course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).
SQL: From Basic to Advanced. Learn SQL skills you can use in an actual, real-world environment
### Specialization - 4 course series
Across these four courses, you’ll learn how to use the PostgreSQL database and explore topics ranging from database design to database architecture and deployment. You’ll also compare and contrast SQL and NoSQL approaches to database design. The skills in this course will be useful to learners doing data mining or application development.
